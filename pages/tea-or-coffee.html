<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Imagine waking up to a cup full of warmth, love, peace
and tranquility. Every sip draws your closer to nature and every different
flavor takes you on a journey to a different country, the world in the palm of
your hands. A simple tea bag can nurture both the body and the soul
that&#8217;s why I choose Tea over Coffee.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%'>Many might argue that Coffee has the ability to
revitalize energy however I believe that I have a natural zest and hunger for
life therefore I am always enthusiastic about taking on new challenges at any
time of the day. Besides what is coffee without caffine? Studies have shown
that most consumers drink coffee for the caffine which can be replaced by
energy drinks, hence why Decaf coffee is not a favorite to many. Caffine is
also known to be very addictive, so how do we really know that Coffee lovers
really appreciate a cup of coffee?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:115%'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:115%'>A Tea bag can never be replaced however it can be
amplified, Weather Served hot on a freezing day or cold on a Humid day (Ice
Tea), we can all agree that after a cup of tea (Hot or Cold) we feel tranquil,
composed and serene. It&#8217;s a medical fact that tea has the ability to
lower one&#8217;s blood pressure which results in a reduction in risk of one
dying from a stroke or heart attack. Green tea is a rich source of flavonoids,
a bioactive compound that can lessen oxidative stress and relieve inflammation
which I tend to suffer from. In fact, most medical profession discourages the
regular consumption of coffee as it may lead to a harmful heart disease. The
Question arises why harm your body why when you can nourish it?Â  </span></p>
